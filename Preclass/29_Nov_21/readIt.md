Pagination => if you visit any websites they have lot of results to show they will never show the results on a one page why ?=> if u send the lot of data on internet your performance foing to degrade bcoz the amount of data will take some time so to avoid that we use pagination

for paginate we need two things 1. page number 2. size 


npm init -y
npm install express --save
npm i mongoose
*imported datbase through terminal* // db name is pagination
