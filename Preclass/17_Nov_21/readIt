pros and cons of express
pros => easy to develope and u ahve to write less code coz u have lot of built in code 
cons => these are slower thsn actual core language reason for that in framewrok there is lot of codde that is not usefull everytime 


1. npm init -y

2. npm install express --save

3. make formal things in app.js

in package.json there is script tag avaliable in that i have written  "server": "npx nodemon app.js" is to run app.js to run this i have run cmd in terminal as npm run server


REST is representational state transfer

get => retrive a list or a single item
psor => when we want to save something on server or on DB
put/patch => update an item put replace the item and patch append to it
delete => to delete an item

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    console.log("Home page get request")
    res.send("Home page get request")
})

to check this open postman and select method and then click on send button u can see the visuvals on terminal and also on postman

app.post("/", (req,res) => {
    console.log("req.body", req.body)
})
express has built in function
to show this just use app.use(express.josn())




middleware is something which runs when request comes in and before the request goes out 

function logger
