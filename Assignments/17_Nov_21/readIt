-----------Assignment-----------

Please create an http server and you can use the users.json by downloading it from mockaroo.com and you need to write following apis

1. get / => this will return simple text "Welcome to Home page"
2. get /users => this will return a list of all users

solution for 1 =>

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Welcome To Home Page")
});


solution for 2 =>

define users as const users = require("./users.json)
app.get('/users', (req,res) =>  {
    const newUser = [...users, req.body]
    res.send(newUser)
})

and then run on postman u'll get an output of all users
